# Tik-Tac-Toe
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
